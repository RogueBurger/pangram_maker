Self Documenting Pangram Maker:
-------------------------------
A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet. A self-documenting pangram is one that follows the general format of:

This sentence contains <number> 'a's, <number> 'b's, <number> 'c's, etc.

For example:

Only a fool would check that this sentence contains exactly six 'a's, one 'b', six 'c's, three 'd's, thirty-four 'e's, five 'f's, two 'g's, ten 'h's, thirteen 'i's, one 'j', two 'k's, five 'l's, one 'm', twenty-two 'n's, seventeen 'o's, one 'p', one 'q', seven 'r's, thirty-two 's's, twenty-six 't's, three 'u's, seven 'v's, eight 'w's, six 'x's, seven 'y's, and one 'z'.

Find the self documenting pangram that begins with "The solution to the CATS problem contains precisely".

PHP or Python are what we use here, but we love playing with all sorts of technology, so pick whatever you want.

Hint: 
-----
On a relatively decent machine, it shouldn't take more than a minute to solve in most cases. In some instances you might have to interrupt and start again if the solution isn't found within a minute. It could mean that the program is stuck on an unsolvable route/path and won't converge.
